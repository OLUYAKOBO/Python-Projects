# Python-Projects
This contains projects that I wrote with python programming language 

The Number to Roman numeral project basically converts numbers from 0 to 30 into their Roman numeral form.
It takes an input from the user and returns the corresponding roman numeral of that input.

The second project titled "Sum to zero" takes  3 numbers from a given list of numbers,adds them and checks whether the result is equal to zero or not

It takes 3 inputs from the user,all of which are numbers available in the list of numbers provided and sums them ,if the sum of the 3 numbers is not equal to zero ,it keeps asking the user for 3 inputs(I used a while loop to this effect).
And when the sum is eventually equal to zero the operation stops.
